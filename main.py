# Write a Python script that takes a time input from the user in 24-hour notation and converts it to 12-hour
# notation with appropriate AM or PM notation. The time should be entered as a string in the format hh:mm,
# with two digits for hours and two digits for minutes, filling with a leading 0 if the number is less than 10. The
# string entered will always be 5 characters long.
